Hey started working on this project for assignment (its already deadline 2 months ago) 
i dont understand properly what is it about for now i started working on this project 
Through this project I started learning backend also 
I make models routes apiresponse apierror controllers db mongo db 
Now i dont understand the crux of this project like on frontend I have a simple form where there is post title content and additional image to add I am using vercel og for generating og image now I want to learn even more good things using project since I added auth using jwt and vine js validation with mongo db how can I use it on frontend in regard to this project and also apply complex things means learn various things so when I put this project on my Resume it looks very good considering todays time 
One thing I currently idea to deploy it to not already available but use someother things 
I have a auth middlewares also setup cloudinary and multer for additional image upload and og image generated so also i can store links of og generated image on mongo db in post model 

so explain me how should I structure my project from now on what things to add what to do with it  -->
